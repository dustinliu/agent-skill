# Implementation Plan

> **Note:** This file tracks implementation progress. Delete after completion.

## EDD Reference

- **EDD Path:** [path/to/edd.md]
- **User Story:** [Brief description or link]

## Pre-implementation

- [ ] **0. Project Setup**
  - Initialize project structure, dependencies, config, DB connection
  - Files: [Files to create]

## Implementation Order

Organize by vertical slice (feature/endpoint). Each task is a complete feature across all layers.

- [ ] **1. [Feature/Endpoint Name]**
  - Layers: [e.g., model → repository → service → handler]
  - Dependencies: [e.g., Task 0]
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - [ ] [Expected behavior 1]
    - [ ] [Expected behavior 2]
    - [ ] [Error case 1]

- [ ] **2. [Feature/Endpoint Name]**
  - Layers: [affected layers]
  - Dependencies: [e.g., Task 1]
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - [ ] [Expected behavior 1]
    - [ ] [Expected behavior 2]

<!-- Add more tasks as needed -->
